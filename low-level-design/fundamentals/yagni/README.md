# The YAGNI Principle

YAGNI short for "You Aren't Gonna Need It"

Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you might need them.

**Benefits of YAGNI**
- Reduced waste: By only implementing what's necessary, you avoid wasting time and effort on unnecessary code.
- Simplified codebase: YAGNI promotes a lean and simple codebase, making it easier to maintain and update.
- Faster development: A laser focus on immediate needs means you get features out the door faster. You're not bogged down by potential "what ifs".
- Improved adaptability: With a flexible and modular codebase, you can respond quickly to changing requirements.

**When YAGNI Might Be Inappropriate**
- Well-Known Requirements: If you know with high certainty a feature is coming soon, building some basic support upfront might be wise.
- Performance-Critical Areas: Sometimes, a less-than-optimal but more general solution is necessary initially to ensure performance targets are met.
